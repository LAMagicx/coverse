    <h1>Welcome to Coverse!</h1>
    <p>Coverse is a unique text adventure game where you, the player, shape the story. Unlike traditional games, there's no predefined plot. Instead, you and other players contribute to a shared narrative.</p>
    <p>Start by exploring an existing story or create your own. As you make choices, the story unfolds, leading you down unexpected paths. If you reach a dead end, don't worry! You can continue the story wherever your imagination takes you.</p>
